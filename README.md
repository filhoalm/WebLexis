# WebLexis
WebLexis provides new ways of visualizing and identify trends and patterns in cancer incidence by age group, calendar period and birth cohort. 

WebLexis incorporates new features like nonparametric singular values adaptive kernel filtration (SIFT) (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37621099/), Comparative APC method (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37853346/). Additionally, it includes new methods for semi-parametric age-period-cohort analysis (SAGE) that provides optimally smoothed estimates of age-period-cohort estimable functions, and stable estimates of lack-of-fit (LOF) (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38406174/).

The tools in WebLexis allow users to uncover fine-scale temporal signals in cancer data and understand cancer heterogeneity with unprecedented specificity. With these new methods, we aim to advance cancer surveillance research and hope to improve our understanding of the birth cohort effects on cancer incidence in the US and in the world.
